## **3. How It Works**
The EA detects **Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)** and executes trades based on the following logic:

### **Fair Value Gap (FVG) Detection**
- **Bullish FVG**: Occurs when the high of the previous candle is below the low of the current candle.
- **Bearish FVG**: Occurs when the low of the previous candle is above the high of the current candle.

### **Trade Execution**
- When a **Bullish FVG** is detected:
  - The EA closes any open sell trades.
  - Opens a buy trade.
  - Draws a green rectangle on the chart to mark the FVG area.
- When a **Bearish FVG** is detected:
  - The EA closes any open buy trades.
  - Opens a sell trade.
  - Draws a red rectangle on the chart to mark the FVG area.

### **Candle Body Filter**
- The EA only opens trades if the candle body size meets the minimum threshold (`CandleBodyMinPoints`).

---

## **4. Visual Indicators**
- **FVG Rectangles**:
  - Bullish FVGs are marked with green rectangles.
  - Bearish FVGs are marked with red rectangles.
- **Candle Markers**:
  - Large candle bodies are marked with arrows (green for bullish, red for bearish).

---

## **5. Logging and Monitoring**
- The EA logs all actions (e.g., FVG detection, trade execution) in the `Experts` tab of the MT5 terminal.
- Use the logs to monitor the EA's performance and troubleshoot any issues.

---

## **6. Best Practices**
1. **Backtesting**:
   - Test the EA on historical data to evaluate its performance.
   - Use the `Strategy Tester` in MT5 to optimize parameters.

2. **Risk Management**:
   - Adjust the `LotSize`, `StopLossPoints`, and `TakeProfitPoints` to match your risk tolerance.
   - Consider using a risk percentage per trade instead of a fixed lot size.

3. **Market Conditions**:
   - The EA works best in trending markets. Avoid using it in choppy or ranging markets.

4. **Timeframe**:
   - The EA can be used on any timeframe, but higher timeframes (e.g., H1, H4) tend to produce more reliable signals.

---

## **7. Troubleshooting**
- **No Trades Opened**:
  - Ensure the EA is attached to the chart and enabled.
  - Check the `Experts` tab for any error messages.
  - Verify that the `FVGMinPoints` and `CandleBodyMinPoints` are not set too high.

- **Incorrect Trade Execution**:
  - Ensure the `MagicNumber` is unique to avoid conflicts with other EAs or manual trades.
  - Check the `StopLossPoints` and `TakeProfitPoints` settings.

- **Chart Clutter**:
  - If too many FVG rectangles are drawn, reduce the `MaxBars` parameter or manually delete unnecessary objects.

---

## **8. Deinitialization**
- When you remove the EA from the chart, it will delete all FVG rectangles and log the deinitialization reason in the `Experts` tab.
